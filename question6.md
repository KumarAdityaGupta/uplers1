## What do you use for source code versioning control and CI/CD?

**Source Code Versioning Control:**

**Git**: it is one of the most widely used distributed version control systems. It allows developers to track changes, collaborate on code, and manage different versions of a project efficiently. Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide hosting and collaboration features for Git repositories.

**Subversion (SVN)**: Subversion is a centralized version control system that tracks changes to files and directories. While it has been largely replaced by Git in recent years, some projects still use SVN for version control.


**Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**

1. **Jenkins**: Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates CI/CD processes. It offers a wide range of plugins and integrations to automate building, testing, and deploying software.

2. **GitHub Actions**: GitHub Actions is a built-in CI/CD service provided by GitHub. It allows developers to create and automate workflows directly within their GitHub repositories.

3. **GitLab CI/CD**: GitLab includes built-in CI/CD capabilities as part of its DevOps platform. It offers features for automating the testing and deployment of code changes.
