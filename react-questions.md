# React:

## What are the pros and cons of class versus functional components in ReactJS?

#### Class Components:
##### Pros:
1. **State Management**: Class components have access to the state object, which allows you to manage and update component-specific data. This is especially useful for components with complex state logic.
2. **Lifecycle Methods**: Class components provide lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount, which allow you to manage side effects and interactions with the DOM.
3. **Legacy Support**: Class components are compatible with older versions of React and libraries that rely on class components, making them suitable for legacy codebases.

##### Cons: 
1. **Verbose**: Class components can be more verbose, with longer code for setting up and maintaining state, lifecycle methods, and binding event handlers.
2. **Complexity**: As your component logic grows, class components can become harder to maintain and understand, leading to potential code complexity.
3. **Performance**: Class components may have slightly worse performance due to the overhead of class instantiation and lifecycle methods.

#### Functional Components with Hooks:
##### Pros:

1. **Simplicity**: Functional components are simpler and have less boilerplate code. They are easier to read and understand, making them a good choice for smaller components.
2. **Reusability**: With React hooks like useState and useEffect, you can manage state and side effects in functional components, making them more reusable and composable.
3. **Performance**: Functional components can be more performant in some cases because they avoid the overhead of class instantiation and lifecycle methods.

Functional Paradigm: Functional components align with the functional programming paradigm, promoting pure functions and making it easier to reason about your code.

##### Cons:

1. **Limited Lifecycle Control**: Functional components have limited control over lifecycle events compared to class components. While useEffect provides similar functionality, it may require additional logic to replicate certain behaviors.
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Functional components with hooks are not compatible with older versions of React. They require React 16.8 or later.
3. **State Management Complexity**: Managing complex state logic in functional components can be challenging, and you may need to use additional libraries like Redux for state management in larger applications.

## What are your favorite react hooks?

React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. Some common React hooks include:

1. **useState**: This hook allows you to add state management to your functional components. It returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it.
```
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

2. **useEffect**: This hook is used for handling side effects in your components, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, and subscriptions. It runs after every render and can mimic the behavior of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in class components.
```
    useEffect(() => {
        // Your side effect code here
    }, [dependencies]);
```

3. **useContext**: This hook allows you to access the context values that have been set higher up in the component tree. It provides a way to pass data to components without having to explicitly pass props through every level.
```
    const contextValue = useContext(MyContext);
```

4. **useReducer**: Similar to useState, this hook is used for state management but is more suitable for complex state logic. It takes a reducer function and an initial state and returns the current state and a dispatch function.

```
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);
```

## Have you written any custom hooks? If yes, what are they?

Yes, I've written several custom hooks. Many of them are designed to call external APIs, authorize users based on their roles, or convert object properties into JSX elements. Below is an example of a custom hook that converts object properties into JSX elements:

```
import React from 'react';

// Custom hook to convert object properties into JSX
function useObjectToJSX(obj) {
  const jsxElements = [];

  for (const key in obj) {
    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      jsxElements.push(
        <div key={key}>
          <strong>{key}:</strong> {obj[key]}
        </div>
      );
    }
  }

  return jsxElements;
}

// Example usage of the custom hook
function MyComponent() {
  const data = {
    name: 'Ankit',
    age: 30,
    city: 'Delhi',
  };

  const jsxElements = useObjectToJSX(data);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Information</h1>
      {jsxElements}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

## Name some of the React global state management libraries that you use and why.
There are several React global state management libraries available, each with its own unique features and use cases. Here are some popular React global state management libraries, along with reasons why you might consider using them:

1. Redux:
Why: Redux is one of the most widely used global state management libraries for React. It provides a predictable and centralized way to manage application state, making it easier to debug and maintain large-scale applications. It's suitable for complex state management needs and integrates well with React using the react-redux library.

2. Context API (with useContext and useReducer):
Why: React's built-in Context API, combined with useContext and useReducer, can be a suitable choice for managing global state in smaller to medium-sized applications. It's lightweight and doesn't require additional libraries. This approach is ideal when you want a simple and straightforward solution without the overhead of external libraries.
