## What http request libraries are you using and why?

- **Axios:**
**Why**: Axios is a popular HTTP client library that is commonly used for making HTTP requests from both browsers and Node.js applications. It provides a simple and consistent API for performing HTTP operations.
**Features**: Axios supports promises, automatic JSON data parsing, request and response interceptors, and the ability to cancel requests, among other features.
Fetch API:

**Why**: The Fetch API is a native JavaScript API for making HTTP requests in modern browsers. It offers a more modern and concise way to make requests compared to older alternatives like XMLHttpRequest.
**Features**: Fetch provides a promise-based interface and supports a wide range of request and response features. It's built into most modern browsers.
jQuery.ajax:

**Why**: jQuery's AJAX module has been a longtime choice for making asynchronous requests in web development. While it's not as commonly used today due to the rise of Fetch and Axios, it's still relevant in legacy projects.
**Features**: jQuery.ajax simplifies making requests and handling responses. It also includes features for handling different data types and making JSONP requests.
